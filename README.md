**JwtML** (pronounced *jot-em-all*)

A new, unstable [JWT](http://jwt.io) handling library for OCaml built in OCaml. 

JwtML will operate on the level of strings and custom Jwt types, no bit mashing required. 

## Status

JwtML is currently a minimum viable product. Parsing is functional and encoding *technically* works but is not yet user friendly. There is minimal token validation.



At the moment various submodules are available at the top-level. This will soon be removed.

## Future

* Remove top level exposed submodules
* Submit to opam
