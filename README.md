# jwtml
**JwtML** (pronounced *jot-em-all*)

A new, unstable [JWT](http://jwt.io) handling library for OCaml built in OCaml. 

JwtML will operate on the level of strings and custom Jwt types, no bit mashing required. 

## Status

jwtml is currently a minimum viable product. Parsing is functional and encoding *technically* works but is not yet user friendly. There is minimal token validation. I will begin putting items in the issue tracker and responding to them.
